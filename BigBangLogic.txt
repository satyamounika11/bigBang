LOGIC:
Whole dataset is assigned to the term = "bigBang"

1) Displaying Information of the Episode by taking the Season number and Episode Number as the argument:

	a) Created a function naming "episodeInformation" and provided parameters "seasonNo" and "episodeNo" along with  
	   dataset name.

	b) Created variables "seasonFound" and "episodeFound" and assigned them to false. If the variables are true,
	   then the data related to that episode will be displayed. As of now, its empty.

	c) Created variables "seasonNo" and "episodeNo" so that whatever the season and episode name is given, it will
	   consider as an argument, which will be taken from window.prompt.

	d) Providing a "for-of" condition where it iterates the data related to season number and episode in the bigBang
	   data.

	e) Provided two If conditions, i.e. one for iterating the season number from the dataset and other If condition 
	   to iterate the episode number. If the condition is True, then the data related to the particular episode is
	   provided through a function namely, json.stringify which converts the whole block of data from dataset into
	   a string and displays the information of particular episode.

	f) Provided another if condition to provide a message when the given season and episode is not found in 
	   dataset.

2) Displaying Information of any number of episodes just by providing the episode numbers as input:

	a) Created a function naming "epDetailsById" and provided REST parameter "epID".

	b) Created variable "idFound" and assigned them to false. If the variable is true,then the data related to that
	   episode will be displayed. As of now, its empty.

	c) The episodes numbers are provided as input through the function "epDetailsById".

	d) Providing a "for-of" condition where it iterates the IDS which are provided as arguments .
	
	e) Providing a "for-of" condition where it iterates the content/data related to that particular arguments from
	   dataset.

	f) Provided an IF condition to check if the provided argument is present in the dataset. If its true, then the data
	   related to that particular episode is displayed.

	g) Provided another if condition to provide a message when the given ID is not found in dataset.

3) Search Episode by its name:

	a) Created a function naming "episdoeData" and provided parameters "name" and "bigBang".

	b) Created a variable "episodeName" and assigned to false. If the "episodeName" is true, then the data related to 
	   that particular episode name is displayed. As of now, its empty.

	c) Created a variable "name" so that whatever the episode Name is given, it will consider as an argument which
	   will be taken from window.prompt.

	d) Providing a "for-of" condition where it iterates the data related to episodes in the bigBang dataset, in 
	   variable "x".

	e) Provided an IF condition to check if the given name is actually present in the dataset through variable x. If
           true, then the data related to that partiular episode is displayed. Here we have provided toLowerCase() 
	   so that the input can be taken irrespective of case sensitivity factor.

	f) Provided another if condition to provide a message if that particular named episode is not available.
